            <p>Working valid means that HTML follows the official rules of the language. For example just like spelling and grammar rules in English or any language, if you misspell a word, the sentence will show but it is still wrong. With that being said, if HTML has no closing tags, or the tags are in the wrong place, or attributes are written incorrectly, it becomes invalid. We can check this easily using validator, the W3C validator. If it shows 0 errors and warnings, that means the page is working valid. To put it briefly, the valid code follows the rules and passes validator without any errors.</p>

            <p>Working semantic means that we are using the right HTML tag for the right job and not just whatever makes it look right. We can also say that by "semantic", we also mean "meaningful". Correct tags that we write in the code, make browsers, search engines and xcreen readers understand the page better.To put it briefly, the code uses the right tags for their meaning, and not just for appearance.</p>
